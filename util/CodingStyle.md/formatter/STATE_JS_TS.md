# STATE_JS_TS.md — JavaScript / TypeScript JAR Support Tracker

Read `STATE_COMMON.md` first — it has the shared commit/ambiguity/testing
conventions this file assumes. `STATE_C_CPP_JAVA.md`/`STATE_KOTLIN.md` (the
other jobs' files) are NOT required reading for this one — only
`STATE_COMMON.md` is.

---

## Purpose

Tracks implementation of JavaScript/TypeScript support in the deterministic
JAR formatter (`util/CodingStyle.md/formatter/`), per `STYLE_JS_TS.md`
(which derives most rules from `STYLE_JAVA.md`/`STYLE_KOTLIN.md` given
JS/TS's C-family brace/paren/statement shape). **Current status is
scaffold-only: dispatch exists only as a "not yet implemented" error thrown
for JS/TS constructs, no real formatting logic exists yet.**

---

## Scope

`STYLE_JS_TS.md` covers latest ECMAScript (ES2024+) and latest TypeScript
(5.x), one shared file for both (TS is a syntactic superset of JS). **Out of
scope entirely** (not just deferred): JSX/TSX — see Open Design Questions
below.

Sections:

1. Baseline directly inherited unchanged from `STYLE.md`/`STYLE_JAVA.md`:
   bracket/paren complexity padding, keyword spacing, `{}` spacing, closing
   comments on blocks, blank line before `return`, `else`/`else if`
   placement, `switch` formatting.
2. Statement termination — always insert explicit semicolons, never rely on
   ASI (opposite of Kotlin's clean no-semicolon default, since JS's ASI is
   an error-recovery mechanism with real hazards).
3. Destructuring and spread (`{...rest}`, `[...items]`) — no space after
   `...`, bracket padding per §1.
4. Template literals — content preserved exactly as written (never reflowed
   /reindented), `${...}` interpolation gets normal expression spacing.
5. Function/method brace style — Allman for named functions/class methods
   (mirrors Java), with K&R/one-liner exceptions for arrow function bodies,
   getter/setter one-liner groups, and empty bodies.
6. Arrow functions — spaced `=>`, same-line no-brace for single-expression
   body, K&R brace for block body; parameter parens always kept even for a
   single untyped parameter.
7. Optional chaining/nullish coalescing (`?.` tight, `??` spaced) — direct
   analog to Kotlin's `?.`/`?:`.
8. Getter/setter accessors — direct application of the existing
   getter/setter one-liner group alignment (STYLE.md §14), since JS/TS
   accessors always have a real block body.
9. Decorators — `@Name`/`@Name(args)`, tight `@`, placement (own-line vs.
   inline) preserved as written, overflow cascade (drop to own line, then
   wrap args).
10. `async`/`await` — `await` as unary prefix, tight against operand.
11. TypeScript type annotations — `: type` colon spacing (Kotlin `: type`
    analog); union/intersection (`|`/`&`) ordinary binary-operator spacing,
    break-style preserved as written on overflow; class field modifier
    priority table (own ordering: `declare`, visibility, `static`,
    `abstract`, `override`, `readonly` — TS-only modifiers slotted relative
    to Java's existing order, cannot reuse Java's table wholesale).
12. Enums — always one-member-per-line (unlike Java's packing convention),
    `=` column-aligned when explicit values are present, closing comment,
    no trailing `;`.
13. Generics (`<T>`) — same tight/loose bracket-complexity approach as
    C++/Java generics.
14. `interface`/`type` alias declarations — member `:` alignment like §11;
    brace style is K&R (container construct, not function/method).
15. Import ordering — group/blank-line shape like Java's import ordering,
    but JS/TS-specific groups (built-in/node:, third-party, local);
    configurable `js-import-order`/`-sort`/`-blank-lines`. Local-import
    path classification logic is explicitly not yet designed (see Open
    Design Questions below — this is the "Import-path classification" open
    item from the style doc, separate from the HTML5/JSX dispatcher
    questions).

Scaffold dispatch lives in the shared `Lang.java`/`Main.java`/
`ServerMode.java`/`Config.java`, described in the routing `CLAUDE.md`
table. This job's own rule class, `rules/JsTsSpecificRule.java`, exists
only as a boilerplate stub (constructor throws
`UnsupportedOperationException`) — no real logic yet.

---

## Resolved Design Decisions

Full text of each decision lives in `RDD_LOG.md` (shared with
`STATE_C_CPP_JAVA.md`/`STATE_KOTLIN.md` — continue the existing `RDD_KEY_n`
numbering, do not restart). See `STATE_COMMON.md`'s lookup convention
(`grep -Fm1`, no `-A`).

| Key | Topic |
|---|---|
| RDD_KEY_182 | §3/§6 destructuring-pattern LHS joins the const/let alignment grid like any ordinary declaration |
| RDD_KEY_183 | §11.1 consecutive `type X = ...` aliases form their own `=`-aligned group, same as const/let |
| RDD_KEY_187 | Class Scoping — no separate JsTokenizer/TsTokenizer etc.; shared curly classes gated internally on `isJs`/`isTs`, concrete rules in one `JsTsSpecificRule.java` |

## Test-Fixture Repos

- `nodejs/node` — large, real, mixed-style JS codebase (core + tooling).
- `expressjs/express` — smaller, idiomatic, widely-read real-world JS.
- `lodash/lodash` — dense functional-style JS, good stress test for
  complexity-based bracket padding (STYLE.md §3.1) on chained calls.
- `microsoft/TypeScript` — the compiler itself; canonical, heavily-typed
  real-world TS at scale; also doubles as a JS fixture.
- `angular/angular` — large, idiomatic, decorator-heavy real TS.
- `nestjs/nest` — decorator- and generic-heavy backend TS, good coverage of
  the type-annotation-alignment cases (§11, §14).
- `vuejs/core` — modern TS with heavy generics and type-level code.

## Test Fixtures (Local)

Planned local dogfood pairs (distinct from the external-repo list above,
which is for corpus-scale validation) are staged in
**FUTURE_TEST_FIXTURES.md**, under its "JavaScript" and "TypeScript"
sections — not duplicated here. Note the pairs are split by extension
(`.js` vs. `.ts`), not shared — same separation C/C++ already have across
their own fixture families, since TS-only constructs (decorators, enums,
generics, interfaces) can't live in a valid `.js` file. See that file for
the pair list and what each covers. Once authored, register pairs in the
Makefile's `INP_FILES` / `test/README.txt`, and empty out
FUTURE_TEST_FIXTURES.md's "JavaScript" and "TypeScript" sections
accordingly.

---

## Class Scoping (post Core/Curly/Indent/Tags refactor)

JS/TS are curly-family (`Lang.isCurly()` covers `isJs`/`isTs` alongside
C/C++/Java/Kotlin). **Resolved (RDD_KEY_187):** no separate `JsTokenizer`/
`TsTokenizer` (or `JsTsTokenizerCurly` intermediate) — JS and TS share
`TokenizerCurly`/`FormatterCurly`/`ScopePipelineCurly`/`MiscRuleCurly`
directly, gated internally on `lang.isJs`/`lang.isTs`, the same way Kotlin
is gated inside those same classes today rather than getting its own
`KotlinTokenizer`/`KotlinFormatter`. Concrete JS/TS-only rule logic (§2–15)
lands in a single `JsTsSpecificRule.java` (boilerplate stub created, throws
`UnsupportedOperationException` until real logic lands), mirroring
`KotlinSpecificRule.java`'s role, gating TS-only additions (type
annotations/interfaces/enums, §11–14) internally on `lang.isTs` rather than
splitting into `JsSpecificRule`/`TsSpecificRule`.

The existing HTML5-dispatcher and JSX/TSX-out-of-scope open questions
below are unaffected by the refactor.

## Open Questions

### Open Design Questions

Documented explicitly here per the style doc's own flagged gaps — not
attempted this session, future work:

- **HTML5 needs its own dispatcher.** A `.html` file can embed inline
  `<script>`/`<style>` blocks that need to be spliced out and handed to
  different sub-formatters (JS/TS for `<script>`, CSS for `<style>`, per
  `STYLE_DATA_FORMATS.md` §4.2). This dispatcher — the splice-out/format/
  splice-back mechanism and its re-indentation handling — is unsolved this
  session and belongs conceptually at the intersection of this job and the
  Data Formats job (tracked separately in `STATE_DATA_FORMATS.md`).
- **JSX/TSX will need their own future dispatcher for the same embedding
  problem**, but with different syntax than HTML5's `<script>`/`<style>`
  case — JSX embeds XML/HTML-like tag syntax directly inside JS/TS
  expression position, a compound-language situation, not a same-file
  JS/TS extension. `STYLE_JS_TS.md` explicitly puts JSX/TSX **out of
  scope entirely** (not merely deferred). Unsolved this session, not
  attempted.
- **Import-path built-in/third-party/local classification (§15)** — the
  resolution logic for classifying an import path into one of the three
  default groups is not yet designed, per the style doc's own "Known Open
  Items" section.

## Checklist

- [ ] Diff `STYLE_JS_TS.md` against `STYLE_JAVA.md`/`STYLE_KOTLIN.md`
      section-by-section to confirm which "Baseline — Directly Inherited"
      (§1) items are already free once shared-class wiring recognizes a JS/
      TS language tag, vs. which need a small additive extension (mirrors
      the Kotlin job's Step 1 scoping-table approach).
- [ ] Tokenizer support pass: survey `STYLE_JS_TS.md` for every token not
      already lexed (template literals, `?.`/`??`, `=>`, decorators `@`,
      spread/rest `...`, TS type-annotation `:`/`|`/`&`/generics `<>`) —
      additive only, re-run full existing C/C++/Java/Kotlin regression
      suite for zero regressions before moving on (same discipline
      `STATE_KOTLIN.md` Step 0 used).
- [ ] Implement §2–15 rule-by-rule, each its own checkpoint commit, per
      `STATE_COMMON.md`'s workflow.
- [x] Author local test fixture pairs per `FUTURE_TEST_FIXTURES.md`'s
      "JavaScript" and "TypeScript" sections (split by extension, `.js` vs.
      `.ts`, since TS-only constructs can't live in a valid `.js` file) and
      register in the Makefile's `INP_FILES` / `test/README.txt`. Done:
      `js_combined_inp/out.js`, `js_comments_inp/out.js`,
      `ts_combined_inp/out.ts`, `ts_comments_inp/out.ts` extracted to `test/`,
      registered commented-out in the Makefile (real logic not yet
      implemented), documented in `test/README.txt`.
- [ ] Real-code testing pass per `STATE_COMMON.md`'s methodology against
      `STYLE_JS_TS.md`'s listed test-fixture repos (`nodejs/node`,
      `expressjs/express`, `lodash/lodash`, `microsoft/TypeScript`,
      `angular/angular`, `nestjs/nest`, `vuejs/core`).
